Webscraping means extracting content and data from website

I intend to use this technique to get Rainfall data from this website 
'http://122.15.179.102/ARS/home/rainfall/

Then,
I have to collect the data and visualize the rainfall data using Matplotlib and seaborn libs

Now,
I have collected the data and displayed
and Visualized too.

To proceed Further,
i can connect it with DB of my choice.
